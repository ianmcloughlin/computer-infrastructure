# Assessment Brief: Computer Infrastructure, Winter 26/27

This assessment gives you an opportunity to show your achievement of the module learning outcomes.
The main part of the assessment is to complete the problems in the [Problems](#problems) section of this document.
Start by making a new GitHub repository solely for this assessment.
Create a new Jupyter notebook named `problems.ipynb` in the root of the repository.
Create a file called [`AGENTS.md`](https://realpython.com/agents-md/) in the root of your repository and copy [the contents of the example agents file in the notes section of this repo into it.](notes/example-agents.md?plain=1)
Submit the repository URL using the link below before the URL submission date.
You should then work consistently on your repository until the final deadline for commits below.
The last commit pushed to GitHub on or before the deadline will be assessed.


> [!IMPORTANT]
> [Submit Your Repository URL Here by 30 September 2026 (ATU Login required)]()  
> 
> Final Deadline for Commits:  
> <ins>**20 December 2026**</ins>  

Always keep your latest work in GitHub.
If you have problems, especially with git, ask for help well before the deadline.
Do not delete your repository without consulting the lecturer.
Disproportionately large commits, especially near the final deadline, will usually not be accepted.
Make sure to consult and adhere to the policies on the student portal, such as those relating to student conduct and plagiarism.

## Target Audience

Complete the assessment with the following target audience in mind: an informed computing professional, such as a prospective employer.
Assume they have a strong background in computing but may not be familiar with the specific language, packages, or tools you use.
They should be able to clone your repository and run any code within it with minimal setup and without any extra help from you.
Include setup instructions in your `README.md`, and keep all necessary data files and images cleanly organized.
If any files are too large to include in your repository, explain this in your `README.md` and, where possible, provide code to automatically download them.

## Organization and Structure

Your submission should be in the `main` branch of your repository.
Include a clear [`README.md`](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/about-readmes), a suitable [`.gitignore` file](https://www.toptal.com/developers/gitignore), and an [accurate `requirements.txt` file](https://realpython.com/what-is-pip/#using-requirements-files).
Avoid including [unnecessary files or folders](https://realpython.com/python-git-github-intro/#what-not-to-add-to-a-git-repo).
Use lowercase file and folder names, except for the usual files like `README.md`.
Do not use spaces or special characters in filenames.
Underscores, hyphens, and full stops are okay.

Your commit history should show how your work evolved: improvements, refinements, and added clarity.
Keep your notebook [reproducible, clean, and concise.](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2202.07233)
Use a [level 1 heading](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax#headings) for the notebook title.
Use [level 2 Markdown headings](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax#headings) to clearly identify each problem within the notebook.
Use Markdown cells to give explanations and insights into your code.

Follow Python coding standards and guidelines such as [PEP8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/).
Write clean, readable, and efficient code using meaningful variable names and consistent formatting.
Break code into smaller, manageable cells whenever possible.
Each code cell should focus on a single step in your overall solution.
Include [meaningful comments](https://realpython.com/python-comments-guide/) and [docstrings](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/#documentation-strings) in your code.
You can use [modules in the standard library](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_library) and any of the packages in the [requirements.txt file in this repository](./requirements.txt) and their dependencies.
Ask before using anything else.

## Submission Checklist

- [ ] **Repository Link Submitted:** You have submitted your GitHub repository URL in the format `https://github.com/username/reponame` via the Microsoft Forms link above.

- [ ] **Agents file included from the start:** You have had the correct `AGENTS.md` in the root of your repository from the start.

- [ ] **Correct Notebook Name:** Your primary submission file is located in the root of the repository and is named exactly `problems.ipynb` (all lowercase, no spaces).

- [ ] **Essential Files:** Your repository includes a `.gitignore`, a `README.md` with setup instructions, and a `requirements.txt` listing all necessary Python packages (e.g., `numpy`).

- [ ] **Notebook Cell Order:** You have restarted the kernel and run all cells in your notebook to ensure they execute in sequential order (1, 2, 3...) without errors, providing a clean and reproducible output.

- [ ] **Folder Organization:** Any extra files are organized into subfolders; specifically, any datasets are in a `/data` folder and any images, plots, or diagrams are in an `/img` folder.

- [ ] **Repository Tidiness:** You have removed all irrelevant files (e.g., `.DS_Store`, `__pycache__`, local checkpoints, or temporary scratchpads).

- [ ] **Environment Reproducibility:** When someone clones your repo, they will likely use the following workflow. Ensure your `README.md` and `requirements.txt` make this process seamless:

    1. `git clone <repo-url>`
    2. `pip install -r requirements.txt`
    3. `jupyter notebook problems.ipynb`

## Marking Scheme

Your submission will be assessed across the following five equally-weighted categories.
Make sure you provide clear evidence within your repository of the criteria listed.
A good submission will meet most of the criteria in each category.
An excellent submission will demonstrably meet all the criteria.
Note that the overall impression your submission makes may influence marks in each category.

### Presentation

- Your repository should be well-organized, with a clear and logical structure.
- Your `README.md` should clearly explain the purpose of your repository and how to run any code it contains.
- Your notebook should present a clear narrative, making it easy to follow your thought process.
- A knowledgeable expert reviewing your repository should be able to understand its contents without your help.

### Research

- Your submission should demonstrate research on relevant topics, showing an understanding of the material.
- You should build upon existing literature and documentation rather than just presenting basic solutions.
- References and comparisons to similar work should be included.
- References should be put into context - how and why they are relevant to your submission.

### Documentation

- Your repository should contain standard files, such as a `README.md`, to provide context for your work.
- All concepts should be clearly and concisely explained within your notebooks.
- Code should include informative comments that clarify its purpose and functionality.
- Your `README.md` and notebook should have clear headings and provide a clear context for their contents.

### Development

- Your code should be efficient and well-structured, effectively addressing the problem at hand.
- Standard programming structures, algorithms, and testing methods should be applied where appropriate.
- The overall architecture of your code should be clean, demonstrating good coding practices.
- Your code should demonstrate your knowledge of established style conventions and norms.

### Consistency

- Each commit should focus clearly on a single unit of work.
- Your commit history should show consistent activity across the assessment period, not a burst of late submissions.
- Your repository should demonstrate incremental review and refinement rather than one-off completion.
- Commits should capture improvements to both code quality and explanations over time.

## Problems

Complete all problems below in your `problems.ipynb` notebook.
Your notebook should tell a story, using Markdown cells to explain your thinking and code cells to perform the technical tasks.
Your notebook must also run from top to bottom on a standard machine in three minutes or less.

### Problem 1: Downloading Stock Market Data

Using the [`yfinance`](https://github.com/ranaroussi/yfinance) Python package, write a function called `get_data()` that downloads five days of hourly stock market data for the following companies:

* NVIDIA (`NVDA`)
* Microsoft (`MSFT`)
* Alphabet (`GOOGL`)
* AMD (`AMD`)
* Palantir (`PLTR`)

The function should:

1. Download the data for all five companies.
2. Save the resulting data into a folder called `data` in the root of your repository.
3. Create the `data` folder if it does not already exist.
4. Save the data using a filename with the format `YYYYMMDD-HHmmss.csv`, where the timestamp records when the data was downloaded.

The function should also return the downloaded data.

### Problem 2: Plotting the Data

Write a function called `plot_data()` that opens the most recent data file in the `data` folder.

For each company, calculate the percentage change in its `Close` price relative to its first recorded observation:

$$
\text{percentage change}
=
\frac{P_t-P_0}{P_0}\times100.
$$

Plot the percentage change for all five companies on the same set of axes.

Your plot should:

- have clearly labelled axes,
- include a legend identifying each company,
- have an appropriate title containing the date of the data,
- make the five series easy to distinguish.

Save the resulting plot into a folder called `plots` in the root of your repository, using a filename with the format:

```text
YYYYMMDD-HHmmss.png
```

Create the `plots` folder if it does not already exist.

In your notebook, briefly explain why plotting percentage change rather than the raw share price makes it easier to compare the performance of companies whose share prices are very different.

### Problem 3: Creating an Executable Script

Create a Python script called `stocks.py` in the root of your repository.

The script should contain the `get_data()` and `plot_data()` functions from the previous problems and should run them in the appropriate order so that executing the script:

1. downloads the latest hourly data;
2. saves the data in the `data` folder; and
3. creates the corresponding plot in the `plots` folder.

Configure the script so that it can be run directly from the terminal using:

```text
./stocks.py
```

This will require you to:

- add an appropriate shebang line,
- give the file executable permissions,
- ensure that the script executes the required functions when run from the terminal.

In your notebook, explain the steps you took to make the Python file executable and describe what happens when the command `./stocks.py` is executed.

### Problem 4: Automating the Analysis with GitHub Actions

Create a [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) workflow that automatically runs your `stocks.py` script every Wednesday morning.

Create the workflow in:

```text
.github/workflows/stocks.yml
```

The workflow should:

1. run automatically every Wednesday morning using a scheduled GitHub Actions workflow,
2. check out your repository,
3. set up an appropriate Python environment,
4. install the Python packages required by your script,
5. run `stocks.py`.

In your notebook, explain each section of the workflow and, in particular, explain how the schedule determines when the workflow runs.
